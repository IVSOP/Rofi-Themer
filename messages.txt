Menu:

m/ -> main menu
m/<theme> -> theme was selected
m/<theme>/<option> -> ...

if the option is a 'dead end', means it has to be applied
	for example, m/1/dunst will apply option 1 to dunst
				 m/1/rofi/* will apply option 1 to everything in rofi
				 but m/1 displays the main table
				 	 m/1/rofi displays rofi table

if option is list: m/theme/option/number, to apply the number

All option: .../*
Back option: just remove the last thing


Read:

r/option/suboption/...
if last is a table, error probably. use * to read all values
